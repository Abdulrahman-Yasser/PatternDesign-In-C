# Pattern 1 : Debouncing Pattern

This simple pattern is used to reject multiple false events arising from intermittent contact of
metal surfaces.<br>
Many input devices for embedded systems use metal-on-metal contact to indicate events of
interest, such as button presses, switch movement, and activating or deactivating relays. As the
metal moves into contact, physical deformation occurs resulting in an intermittent bouncing
contact until the vibrations dampen down. This results in an intermediate contact profile
